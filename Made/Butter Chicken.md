#### Ingredients

##### Serves: 6

#### Chicken Marinade:

	* 2.2 lbs (1 kg) boneless, skinless chicken breast cut in 1" - 2" cubes
	* 2 tbsp lemon juice
	* 2 cloves garlic, minced
	* 1 tbsp garam masala
	* 1 tsp kosher salt

#### Sauce: 

	* ¼ cup vegetable oil
	* 2 ½ cups chopped onion (about 2 medium-large)
	* 2 tbsp coarsely chopped garlic
	* 2 tbsp Garam Masala
	* 2 tsp paprika
	* ¼ tsp cinnamon
	* 2 tsp kosher salt, or to taste
	* 2 cups diced no-salt-added canned tomatoes
	* ¾ cup cream
	* 2 tbsp butter
	* Chopped cilantro, to garnish (optional)

#### Directions

##### Marinade
	
	1. Mix together all the marinade ingredients and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the sauce.  You can also make this ahead the night before and let sit in the fridge overnight. 

##### Sauce
	
	1. Heat oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add onions and slowly cook until golden, about 20 minutes.  If they start to get crispy or start browning quickly, reduce the heat.  You want them to be nice and soft.

	2. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in garam masala, paprika, cinnamon and salt; cook 1 minute more. Add tomatoes; cook 2 minutes, then add cream and carefully puree using an immersion blender (or you can do this in batches in a regular blender).I normally add a little more garam masala because I love the taste and really like a more bold flavour, so don’t be shy to add more.

	3. Return sauce to saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add chicken to the sauce, cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until cooked through, about 12 minutes (or until chicken is fully cooked through). 

	4. Stir in butter, taste and add more salt to taste.

	5. Serve this with basmati rice, a sprinkle of cilantro on top, a lemon wedge and of course some delicious naan bread.
